Then, set up your environment variables in `.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-here"
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN="your-uploadthing-token"
```

bunx prisma migrate dev
bunx prisma generate
```

Seed the database (optional):

```bash
bun run seed
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
